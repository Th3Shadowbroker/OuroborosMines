# This keys define all materials that can be mined.
# In error-logs these materials are known as mining- or mine-materials.
#
# Here is an example for a custom material:
#
# stone: <-- The key represents the mined material.
#   replacements: <-- The replacements-list contains every material that will could replace the mined material.
#     -cobblestone_block <-- In this case stone can be replaced with cobblestone-blocks.
#   cooldown: 10 <-- The cooldown (in seconds) defines the time for the mined block to respawn.
#
# Additional customizations:
#   Randomizing cooldowns:
#     Cooldowns can be randomized. Just use a range as cooldown. A cooldown with the value of "10-60" will generate
#     a random cooldown between ten and 60 seconds.
#   Rich deposits:
#     To make mining even more interesting it is possible to give regular ores a small chance to replace themselves with
#     their own material. You can do so by adding the rich-chance property to a material defined in the configuration.
#     This property accepts doubles as type, which means you're allowed to use frictional digits.
